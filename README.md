# 🧑‍🍳 ServerSight
## Server Management System
ServerSight serves as a tool that helps managers keep track of their server/employee performance, to further help them
make adjustments in their rotation and make managing easier.
It provides managers with data-driven insights through tracking individual server's sales, total tables served,
and the reviews that the servers obtained through a visual chart, implemented through Chart.js!
